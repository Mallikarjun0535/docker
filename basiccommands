docker images --> for find the images of the docker
docker pull nginx:1.24 --> for pulling the default images from the docker hub 
docker pull nginx  --> this will pull the latest image of the docker
docker run nginx --> it will run the images in the container 


docker ps  -> will check all the images running as a container
docker stop "continerid" --> it will stop the running with container id
docker start "continerid" --> it will start running with container id

docker run -d  ngnix  --> It will run the images but the command prompt is available for further commands 
docker run --> will run the new container every time 
docker ps -a  -->. will help us to view all the containers that are running or stopped.


when we want to access from the locahost we have to give some port
------------------------------------------------------------------

docker run -p 9000:80 ngnix --> by default nginx is not accessible from the local machine we are given the following command with specific port 9000 so it will access 9000 from the local machine


we can start and  stop and also a container with the name  
--------------------------------------------------------------
docker run --name malliknginx -p 9007:80 nginx --> we have assigned a name to the docker container as malliknginx so can start and stop same container with this name

docker stop malliknginx --> stopping the container
docker start malliknginx --> starting the container
